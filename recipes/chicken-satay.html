    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Fire up the grill for this Indonesian-inspired chicken satay. Skewers of perfectly cooked chicken are served with a fresh and flavourful peanut sauce. So delicious that no one will be able to have just one!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>20 wooden skewers</li>
      <li>6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut lengthwise into strips</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon peanut oil</li>
      <li>¼ onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Put wooden skewers in a shallow dish and cover with water. Let soak for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Place chicken strips into a bowl. Combine soy sauce, tomato sauce, peanut oil, garlic, pepper, and cumin in a small bowl; mix to combine. Pour over chicken strips and mix so chicken is well coated on all sides. Marinate for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, make the peanut sauce. Add 1 tablespoon oil to a hot skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add peanut butter, sugar, soy sauce, and water. Mix well. Cook until sauce has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Add lemon juice and remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread each chicken strip onto a skewer.
      </li>
      <li>Place skewers on the preheated grill and cook for a total of 10 minutes, flipping once halfway through cooking. Serve the satay skewers immediately with the peanut sauce for dipping.
